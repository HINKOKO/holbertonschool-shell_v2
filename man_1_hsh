.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]Simple Shell - V2\f[R] \- Holberton\[cq]s school specialization "Low_Level and Algorithms" project for
creating a basic command line interpreter written in C
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]./hsh\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]Simple Shell\f[R] is a Holberton\[cq]s school project for
creating a minimalistic command line interpreter written in C
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
This simple shell read line from the STDIN_FILENO, parse it and search
if any alias matches the command, then checks if any built\-in
corresponds, then finally check on the PATH.
If no command is found, it will print an error message.
.SH INVOCATION
.PP
Compile the Simple Shell using the Makefile provided with the repository using command \[lq]make all\[rq], it will lauch compilation with the options shown below:
.PP
.B \ \ \ \ \ gcc \[en]Wall \-Werror \-Wextra \-pedantic *.c \-o hsh
.PP
Note the use of the wildcard \[lq]*\[rq] which will compile all the C
programs concurrently.
.PP
Simple Shell can be run in two modes, Interactive and Non\-Interactive.
The Interactive is run by entering the below command in your terminal
.PP
.B\ \ \ \ \ $ ./hsh
.PP
It will display a prompt, of this format \[lq]> \[rq] and you will be
able to type command and press enter.
.PP
The Non\-Interactive mode is run through the use of shell\-scripts.It
involves the use of piping (`|'): \ \ \ \ \  > echo `ls' | ./hsh
.SH BUILTINS
.PP
.B The following builtins are supported:
.PP 
\- exit - exits the program
.PP
\- env - prints the environments variables
.PP
\- cd - change current directory to specified one, switch to home if no arguments provided to cd
.PP
\- help - display a basic message of help, help on functions yet to come
.SH BUGS
.PP
At this stage (April the 28th, 2023), you won't be able to properly set a new environment variable using built-in \[lq]setenv\[rq], which causes also the \[lq]cd\[rq] command to be able to perform \[lq]cd - \[rq] only once. On the other hand, No memory leaks are present.
